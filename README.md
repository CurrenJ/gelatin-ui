Gelatin UI

A composable, performant UI toolkit for Minecraft (Fabric + NeoForge via Architectury Loom). Build modern screens with a clean builder API and extendable components.

Highlights
- Declarative tree of UIElements (Label, SpriteRectangle, SpriteButton, ItemRenderer, ProgressBar, etc.)
- Predictable layout with VBox/HBox
- Dirty flags, bounds caching, and culling for performance
- Smooth interpolation and keyframe animations
- Debug overlays and culled inspector for development

Docs
- Full developer guide lives in docs/. Start with docs/README.md.

Examples
- See common/src/main/java/io/github/currenj/gelatinui/TestScreen.java for a runnable demo screen that exercises most features.

License
- See LICENSE (or project metadata) for details.
